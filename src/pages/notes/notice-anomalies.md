An excerpt from [_How to Get New Ideas_](https://paulgraham.com/getideas.html) by [Paul Graham](https://x.com/paulg)

> "The way to get new ideas is to notice anomalies: what seems strange, or missing, or broken? You can see anomalies in everyday life (much of standup comedy is based on this), but the best place to look for them is at the frontiers of knowledge."
