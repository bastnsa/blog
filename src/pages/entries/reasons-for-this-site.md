Why did I create this site? I can think of many, but the following reasons stand out to me the most: interest, reference, and exposure.

## Interest

I think my interest in creating this site has been summoned in part by a mixture of curiosity and inspiration. Although I am intrigued by what others are building and posting on Twitter, I think the part I find more fascinating is the way other people think, and more specifically, the _difference_ in the approach they take when expressing similar ideas.

As expected, I have read plenty of blog entries and frequently follow some RSS feeds. This has led me down many rabbit holes and introduced me to many other engaging areas I wouldn't have otherwise encountered. The exposure of ideas coupled with the fact that each person has their own way of doing things has, quite frankly, **inspired** me. So like many others, I thought it would be a good idea to craft [my own](https://paulgraham.com/own.html) digital space.

## Reference

<div class="side-note">
    <p>I plan to write an entry that dives into how I've built this site and additions I have in mind, but for now I'll just glance through my immediate idea.</p>
</div>

The `Entries` page will function like a typical blog in which my main track of writing will be contained. Under `Notes` I'll attempt to partake in actual note-taking, but I'll mostly be jotting down whatever catches my attention.

I truly believe making a thing, which at first might appear as purely self-indulging, more resourceful is key to ensuring something has the potential to add value to your life. With this in mind, I'm sure this site will function as a dump for whatever writings delight me in the present moment, but at the same time, it will also allow me to look back at previous versions of myself with more clarity.

## Exposure

My aim is to strike a balanceâ€”writing what genuinely interests me while remaining open to new insights. The first two reasons are good enough for a "why," but if I'm being honest with myself, making new connections with like-minded people and knowing others find what I publish here interesting can be, in many ways, even more fulfilling. As others have done for me, I hope this site introduces you to new ideas or enables you to find a perspective that helps clarify your own thinking.
